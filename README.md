**Key Tasks:**
Imported and cleaned data in SAS, removing duplicates and handling missing values.
Standardized categorical values, formatted dates/currency, and flagged date issues.
Sorted data chronologically and removed unnecessary columns.
Analyzed yearly claim trends and generated visual reports.
Built a state-level dynamic analysis for claim types, sites, dispositions, and settlement amounts.
Compiled insights into a single PDF report with statistical summaries and visualizations.

Checked baggage incidents dominate, indicating security and handling concerns.
Further analysis by airport, state, and item category can improve loss prevention.


**Tourism Data Analysis – Cleaning & Merging**
**Objective:** 
Processed and merged tourism data for trend analysis and insights.

**Key Tasks:**
Cleaned and categorized tourism types, categories, and series.
Converted scaled values (_2014) into numeric Y2014 format.
Merged cleaned_tourism with country_info, creating final_tourism (matched data) and nocountryfound (unmatched records).
Assigned and formatted continent labels.
**Impact:**
Improved data accuracy and enabled better tourism trend analysis.
